# @allons-y/opx-lint-md

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- b1e595a: opx is now licensed under Apache-2.0. The license adds an express patent grant and clear terms for commercial use, so adopting the toolkit in a company project needs no extra legal review of MPL file-level copyleft. The `license` field in every published package and the `LICENSE` file shipped with each now match.

### Patch Changes

- 9964328: Faster startup and one shared lint runner source.

  - `@allons-y/opx` runs the post-commit hook through `node_modules/.bin` on `PATH` instead of `npx`, which took about a second to start. The installer also inserts that line above a trailing `exit` in an existing hook, where it used to append after it and never run.
  - `@allons-y/opx-cli` loads only the command being run and reads `fileTypes` and `branch` from git on first use, so `lint`, `release`, and `hook` skip those git calls.
  - The lint plugins share one runner source that is copied into each package only when it is packed, so the engine stays free of any specific tool and each plugin can opt out.
  - `@allons-y/opx-release` reads `.env` with `process.loadEnvFile()` and drops the `dotenv` dependency.
